ComfyUI-LTXVideo is a collection of custom nodes for ComfyUI, designed to provide useful tools for working with the LTXV model.
The model itself is supported in the core ComfyUI [code](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/tree/master/comfy/ldm/lightricks).
The main LTXVideo repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video).

# ⭐ 16.07.2025 - LTXV 0.9.8 Release ⭐

### 🚀 What's New
1. **LTXV 0.9.8 Model**<br>
   The new model and its distilled variants offer improved prompt understanding and detail generation<br>
   👉 [13B Distilled model](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.8-distilled.safetensors)<br>
   👉 [13B Distilled model 8-bit](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-13b-0.9.8-distilled-fp8.safetensors)<br>
   👉 [2B from 13B Distilled model](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-2b-0.9.8-distilled.safetensors)<br>
   👉 [2B from 13B Distilled model 8-bit](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/ltxv-2b-0.9.8-distilled-fp8.safetensors)<br>
   👉 [IC Lora Detailer](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-detailer-13b-0.9.8/resolve/main/ltxv-098-ic-lora-detailer-comfyui.safetensors)<br>


2. **Autoregressive Generation**
   Introducing new ComfyUI nodes that enable virtually infinite video generation. The new **LTXV Looping Sampler** node allows generation of videos with arbitrary length and consistent motion. **ICLoRAs** are supported as well—by providing guidance from existing videos (e.g., depth, pose, or Canny edges), you can generate long videos in a video-to-video manner.

   👉 [Long Video2Video Generation Flow](#long-video-generation)

3. **Detailer ICLoRA**
   Introducing the **Detailer ICLoRA**, which enhances generated latents with fine details by applying a few additional diffusion steps. This results in significantly more detailed generations.

# ⭐ 8.07.2025 - LTXVideo ICLora Release  ⭐
### 🚀 What's New in LTXVideo ICLoRA

1. **Three New ICLoRA Models**
   Introducing powerful in-context LoRA models that enable precise control over video generation:
   - Depth Control: [LTX-Video-ICLoRA-depth-13b-0.9.7](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-depth-13b-0.9.7)
   - Pose Control: [LTX-Video-ICLoRA-pose-13b-0.9.7](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-pose-13b-0.9.7)
   - Edge/Canny Control: [LTX-Video-ICLoRA-canny-13b-0.9.7](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-canny-13b-0.9.7)

2. **New Node: 🅛🅣🅧 LTXV In Context Sampler**
   A dedicated node for seamlessly integrating ICLoRA models into your workflow, enabling fine-grained control over video generation using depth maps, pose estimation, or edge detection.

3. **Example Workflow**
   Check out [example workflow](#iclora) for a complete example demonstrating how to use the ICLoRA models effectively.

4. **Custom ICLoRA Training**
   We've released a trainer that allows you to create your own specialized ICLoRA models for custom control signals. Check out the [trainer repository](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video-Trainer) to get started.


# ⭐ 9.06.2025 – LTXVideo VAE Patcher, Mask manipulation and Q8 LoRA loader nodes.  ⭐
1. **LTXV Patcher VAE**<br> The new node improves VAE decoding performance by reducing runtime and cutting memory consumption by up to 50%. This allows generation of higher-resolution outputs on consumer-grade GPUs with limited VRAM, without needing to load the VAE partially or decode in tiles.<br>
⚠️ On *Windows*, you may need to add the paths to the *MSVC compiler (cl.exe)* and *ninja.exe* to your system environment PATH variable. <br>
2. **LTXV Preprocess Masks**<br>
Preprocesses masks for use with the LTXVideo model's latent masking. It validates mask dimensions based on VAE downscaling, supports optional inversion, handles the first frame mask separately, combines temporal masks via max pooling, applies morphological operations to grow or shrink masks, and clamps values to ensure correct opacity. The result is a set of masks ready for latent-space masking.
3. **LTXV Q8 Lora Model Loader**<br>
Applying LoRA to an FP8-quantized model requires special handling to preserve output quality. It's crucial to apply LoRA weights using the correct precision, as the current LoRA implementation in ComfyUI does so in a non-optimal way. This node addresses that limitation by ensuring LoRA weights are applied properly, resulting in significantly better quality. If you're working with an FP8 LTXV model, using this node guarantees that LoRA behaves as expected and delivers the intended effect.

### Technical Updates

We introduce the __STGGuiderAdvanced__ node, which applies different CFG and STG parameters at various diffusion steps. All flows have been updated to use this node and are designed to provide optimal parameters for the best quality.
See the [Example Workflows](#example-workflows) section.

# 5.03.2025 ⭐ LTXVideo 0.9.5 Release ⭐

### LTXVideo 0.9.5 introduces:

### Technical Updates

Since LTXVideo is now fully supported in the ComfyUI core, we have removed the custom model implementation. Instead, we provide updated workflows to showcase the new features:

1. **Frame Conditioning** – Enables interpolation between given frames.
2. **Sequence Conditioning** – Allows motion interpolation from a given frame sequence, enabling video extension from the beginning, end, or middle of the original video.
3. **Prompt Enhancer** – A new node that helps generate prompts optimized for the best model performance.
   See the [Example Workflows](#example-workflows) section for more details.

### LTXTricks Update

The LTXTricks code has been integrated into this repository (in the `/tricks` folder) and will be maintained here. The original [repo](https://github.com/logtd/ComfyUI-LTXTricks) is no longer maintained, but all existing workflows should continue to function as expected.

## 22.12.2024

Fixed a bug which caused the model to produce artifacts on short negative prompts when using a native CLIP Loader node.
